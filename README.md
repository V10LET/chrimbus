As Chrimbus grows near, so does the anticipated annual anxiety. *What do I get? Who do I give to? How do I remember what to give whom?* This is where the Chrimbus CRUD App comes in.

Saving your name, friends, gifts and Chrimbus, this app allows you to —
1. Make a list of the friends you *want* to give to.
2. Store gift ideas and their respective prices.
3. Edit or delete friends or gifts — for all of your "friends".
4. Assign gifts to your friends to see who you are giving what.

All so that you can easily recall what, who and which gift with less stress and more Chrimbus cheer. And if you decide you want to keep giving next Chrimbus, all of your lists are saved and ready to refer back to at anytime.

Although we cannot make Chrimbus a less awkward event, it never again has to be unplanned. Merry Chrimbus to all, and to all a strategic Chrimbus!
